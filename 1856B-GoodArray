You are given an array of positive integers a
 of length n
.

Let's call an array of positive integers b
 of length n
 good if:

ai≠bi
 for all i
 from 1
 to n
,
a1+a2+…+an=b1+b2+…+bn
.
Does a good array exist?

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array a
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if there exists a good array, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

def good_array(n,l):
    if n==1:
        return "NO"
    c=l.count(1)
    s=sum(l)
    if s>=c+n:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
def main():
    t=int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n=int(input())
        l=list(map(int,input().split()))
        print(good_array(n,l))
main()
recognized as positive responses.
