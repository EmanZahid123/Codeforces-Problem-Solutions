Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky.

Input
The single line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked.

Output
In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

def case(n):
    if n%4==0 or n%7==0 or n%44==0 or n%77==0 or n%74==0 or n%47==0 or n%444==0 or n%777==0 or n%477==0 or n%474==0 or n%744==0 or n%747==0 or n%447==0 or n%774==0:
        return "YES"
    l=list(map(int,str(n)))
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i]==4 or l[i]==7:
            pass
        else:
            return "NO"
    return "YES"
def main():
    n=int(input())
    print(case(n))
 
main()
